                <p>The online source portal “History of the German-Jewish Diaspora” is published by the Moses Mendelssohn Center for European-Jewish Studies (MMZ) in Potsdam and maintained by the project team there. It is part of a larger platform on European Jewish history realized jointly by the MMZ and the Institute for the History of German Jews (IGdJ). This new service, located at the MMZ with the Diaspora Source Portal as one of its core modules, is to be expanded into a central platform within the field of Jewish history. Further information on the portal Jewish History online is available at <ref
